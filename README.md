# Convolutional Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE)

A Convolutional β-VAE in PyTorch based loosely off of the Conv VAE used in the World Models research paper. The overall goal is to test its effectiveness in dimension reduction (training a seperate model on its latent vectors as in World Models).
